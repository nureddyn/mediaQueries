        <p class="p-1">Gon is enthusiastic and spontaneous, sometimes to his detriment. However, he's only so gung-ho about things because he sees life as being full of possibilities that he can use to grow stronger and find his father Ging.</p>
        <p class="p-2">He becomes enraged when he sees Neferpitou. He blames himself for Kite's death, thinking he was too weak and didn't leave when he should have.</p>
        <p class="p-3">Gon makes a Nen contract to get enough power to defeat Neferpitou. He sacrifices all of his Nen and puts his life on the line.</p>
